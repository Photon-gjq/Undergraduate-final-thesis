# Undergraduate-final-thesis
This is my undergraduate thesis written in LaTeX. I copy Spinor and Spacetime Vol 1,Penrose 1984 (partically) to Chinese, and explain why massless spin 3/2 Rarita Schwinger Field can only exist in Ricci Flat spacetime(don't consider the backreaction with gravity, the background field). Moreover, the tex code of including a vectorized mathcha logo(tikz) is included.
