The results are specified for fields of integer and half-integer spin: A suitable generalization of Proca's equation and Lagrangian leads to an equivalent tensor description of bosonic fields, whereas a generalization of Dirac's theory allows an equivalent description of fermionic fields by use of bispinors. A (7(l)-gauge invariance of the Lagrangian is obtained by coupling to an electromagnetic potential. The current vector of the spin-s field is derived.},

To simplify the algebra, we study a two-component left chiral reduction of the massless theory. We formulate the classical theory in both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian form for a general non-Abelian gauging, and analyze the constraints and the Rarita-Schwinger gauge invariance of the action. An explicit wave front calculation for Abelian gauge fields shows that wave-like modes do not propagate with superluminal velocities. An analysis of Rarita-Schwinger spinor scattering from gauge fields shows that adiabatic decoupling fails in the limit of zero gauge field amplitude, invalidating various "no-go" theorems based on "on-shell" methods that claim to show the impossibility of gauging Rarita-Schwinger fields. Quantization of Rarita-Schwinger fields, using many formulas from this paper, is taken up in the following paper.},

After considering the twistorial methods to study such massless helicity-3/2 fields, we show in flat space–time that the charges of spin-3/2 fields, defined topologically by the first Chern number of their spin-lowered self-dual Maxwell fields, are given by their twistor space, and in curved space–time that the (anti-)self-duality of the space–time is the necessary condition. Since in N=1 supergravity torsions are the essential ingredients, we generalize our space–time to that with torsion (Einstein–Cartan theory), and investigate the consistency of existence of spin-3/2 fields in this theory. A simple solution to this consistency problem is found: The space–time has to be conformally (anti-)self-dual, left-(or right-) torsion-free. The integrability condition on α-surface shows that the (anti-)self-dual Weyl spinor can be described only by the covariant derivative of the right-(left-)handed torsion.},
